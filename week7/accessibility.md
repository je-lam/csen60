### So what?
* Some people have (color) blindness, deafness, missing limbs, SLOW INTERNET, SLOW computers, mobile devices, etc.
* There are actually laws behind this so you could get sued for not providing accessibility options for your site. (Thanks ADA)
* Circling back to semantic tags, keeping accessibility in mind will be great for SEO.
## General Notes
* Screen readers are necessary for blind users. Again, this is why semantic tags are so important.
* Minimum CONTRAST ratios according to [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
  * AA: 5:1
  * AAA: 7:1
