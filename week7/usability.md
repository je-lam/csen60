# UI/UX Design Lecture
[UI/UX Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uNc3Vg6YJ3q50268kGEPBhIHSbDHmQBiTJEyppx6aT0/edit#slide=id.p)
* UX: User experience, how you use/navigate the webpage. Is it intuitive?
* UI: Visuals. E.g. what color is the button/background/border?
## Notes
* A lot of priniciples in usability/UI apply to marketing. Normally, we don't want to have a lot of long text because people don't like to read.
* Responsive design is important for adjusting to various screen sizes (think about mobile devices)
* Tips for good Search Engine Optimization:
  * Semantic tags (duh)
  * Only one h1 tag per page
  * header, main, footer tags.
  * alt text for images
  * aria labels (It's an attribute designed to help assistive technology (e.g. screen readers) attach a label to an otherwise anonymous HTML element.)

### Things to avoid:
See: https://colorlib.com/wp/bad-websites/
* Long text (people hate reading that stuff)
* Cluttered layouts
* Requires horizontal scrolling (circling back to responsive design)
* Poorly chosen colors with bad contrast or just plain ugly (don't put black text over a dark blue BG)
* Bad navigation controls

Other issues:

* Too much useless content on the main page

### Notes for Good sites
* A user typically takes 3 seconds to decide whether a site is worth going through before hopping off or staying on the site.
* If a page has a lot of content, a navigational tool is a MUST
*Straightforward and simple
## Exercise: Bad Websites
Site 7 from [colorlib](https://colorlib.com/wp/bad-websites/): https://www.tagteamsigns.com/
* "WHO WE ARE" has bad color contrast between the text and background image.
* A lot of scrolling for not a lot of content.
