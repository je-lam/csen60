# Logistical information
* 3 hours max time (should take a lot less though)
* Will be next week Friday in CASA 007 (NOT 008)
* 25 questions, 2 points each for a total of 
* Recall and comparison questions
# Actual review
## Javascript
* Focus on the DOM
* Fetch API (understanding how it works, how we use it, etc.)
  * Main idea: If you want to fetch data (e.g. add to cart), how do you communicate from the laptop to the server to do this? You use an HTTP request to do so.
## UI/UX
* General usability and best practices
* Jakob's law of web experience
  * Users spend most of their time on other sites
* Website structure
  * Q: Any specifics?
  * A: Focus on the slides with Web Organization and stuff
* SEO
  * Q: Do we need to know all 10 of Nielson's Heuristics?
  * A: No you don't have to memorize these. It'll be questions like "is this piece of text better than that". BUt you should at least know what SEO is and what aspects help you with SEO.
## Accessibility
* Be familiar with devices
* Be aware of color contrast values
  * https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
## Network/Servers
* What is architecture referring to?
* What does DNS do?
* What is HTTP?
* What are you using APIs for?
* What does a Hono Server do? How does it help you?
* Q: Client-side rendering vs Server-side rendering
  * A: Don't expect a question on this. Short answer: Where are you fetching your data?
  * Client-side is loading the page and fetching from the server. Quick response time but incomplete
  * Server: already on the server. Fetch while at the server. This takes longer.
* Remember the really common requests, e.g. 404, 200,
## Web Security
* Attacks
  * XSS (cross-site scripting)
  * DDoS
  * Man in the middle
* What is encryption?
* HTTPS vs HTTP
* WHat are web certificates?
* Don't bother going through keys because he didn't cover it
## Web Privacy
* Cookies
* ToS vs Privacy Policy
  * Fair warning: You will need to decide between two VERY similar answer choices.
  * ToS: How you use the website and what you're allowed to do
  * Privacy Policy: How the data you give the website is used
* Data collection use cases
  * These can be either nefarious or good for us.
  * e.g. Ad-tracking, driving a metric, behavior logging
* Various regulatory bodies such as GDPR
Q: Is everything fair game on the web privacy slides?
A: Pretty much yeah

Q: Thoughts on firebase/firestore?
A: Those are backend stuff, I've only heard of those. Just try out different things and figure out what you like.
Q: What did you use for MySyllabi?
A: I used a separate frontend and backend. For the database I used Mongo.
* How do you learn all those things? Through DOING. Project-based learning is the most effective way for you to learn web dev and web design.
