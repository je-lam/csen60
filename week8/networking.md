* Part of the lab tomorrow is to explore the "Network" tab of the Inspector.
* GET, POST, PUT & PATCH are the most common HTTP requests.
* Ping simply allows you to check whether or not you can actually get a response from a website.
* Curl is a terminal command you can use to request data from a server and to check if a website works.
* Postman is the same as Curl except it's a fully-fledged application/GUI dedicated to Curl statements.
* DNS (Domain Name System): Computers understand numbers. If you were to Ping google.com in terminal, you would get a number. Paste that number into the browser and you would open google.com.
* [How to use JS Fetch API!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
